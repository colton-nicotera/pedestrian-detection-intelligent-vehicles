# Pedestrian Detection for Intelligent Vehicles

Colton Nicotera

As we approach the advent of intelligent vehicles, the safety of humans must remain the top priority. Hundreds of pedestrians die each year from traffic collisions in Canada alone, and an intelligent vehicle may not have time to react to a pedestrian in the road by using its internal sensors alone. By using street-mounted cameras aimed at intersections or crosswalks, this project aims to give intelligent cars another sense that is not blocked by street-level obstacles. Using a video feed as input, the software will analyze the crosswalk using Computer Vision & Machine Learning technologies to determine if pedestrians are crossing or attempting to cross, and alert nearby vehicles before they can view the intersection.
